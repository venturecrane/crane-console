prompt = """
Send a heartbeat to prevent your session from timing out.

## Execution

### 1. Check Session

Call `crane_context` MCP tool. If no active session, tell the user to run /sod first.

### 2. Confirm Active

Display:
```
Heartbeat sent.
Session: {session_id}
Your session will stay active for 45 minutes from this heartbeat.
```

## When to Use

- Working on long tasks (>30 minutes)
- Want to keep session active while reading/researching
- Not needed if actively using /sod, /update, or /eod

## Notes

- Sessions become "abandoned" after 45 minutes without heartbeat
- Recommended interval: every 10-15 minutes during long tasks
- Safe to call frequently (idempotent)
