description = "End of Day - Auto-generate handoff and end session"

prompt = """
You are ending your development session.

Execute the End of Day script to auto-generate a handoff and end the session:

!{bash scripts/eod-universal.sh}

The script will:
- Find your active session in Crane Context Worker
- Auto-generate a handoff summary from:
  - Git commits in your current session
  - GitHub issue/PR activity
  - Work completed and in-progress items
- Create a structured handoff for the next session
- End your session cleanly

The handoff will be stored in Crane Context Worker and automatically loaded
when the next session starts with /sod.

If you have a specific session ID to end, you can pass it as an argument:
!{bash scripts/eod-universal.sh <session-id>}
