Review and update venture portfolio data. Collects live signals, compares against current records, and presents changes for Captain approval.

## Status Taxonomy

| Status     | BVM Stages                  | Badge  | Criteria                                                                    |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `building` | IDEATION, DESIGN, PROTOTYPE | gray   | Code exists. No production deployment serving real users.                   |
| `beta`     | MARKET TEST                 | yellow | Production URL returns HTTP 200. Real users have access (even invite-only). |
| `live`     | SCALE, MAINTAIN             | green  | Generally available. No invite gate. Active users.                          |
| `paused`   | PIVOT/KILL                  | orange | Development stopped. Under evaluation. Captain decides.                     |
| `sunset`   | post-KILL                   | muted  | Shut down. Historical record.                                               |
| `internal` | any                         | blue   | Studio tooling. Not a user-facing product.                                  |

### Transition Evidence
- `building` -> `beta`: Production URL returns HTTP 200 AND at least one non-founder user has access
- `beta` -> `live`: Invite gate removed. In beta 2+ weeks with no critical bugs
- Any -> `paused`/`sunset`: Captain explicitly decides (never automated)

## Execution

### Step 1: Collect Signals

For each venture in `config/ventures.json` where `portfolio.showInPortfolio` is `true`:

1. **GitHub activity** - Use `gh api repos/{org}/{venture-code}-console` to get last push date and open issue/PR count
2. **Production URL** - If `portfolio.url` is set, run `curl -s -o /dev/null -w \"%{http_code}\" {url}`
3. **VCMS executive summaries** - Use crane_notes MCP tool with tag \"executive-summary\"
4. **Cloudflare resources** - Use workers_list and d1_databases_list MCP tools to inventory deployed infrastructure

Also check ventures with `showInPortfolio: false` for basic health.

### Step 2: Detect Drift

Compare signals against current portfolio data. Flag:
- Status says `live`/`beta` but URL returns non-200 or is missing
- Status says `building` but URL is healthy (might be ready for `beta`)
- No commits in 30+ days for a `building` venture
- BVM stage in VCMS doesn't match `bvmStage` in ventures.json

### Step 2b: Collect Code Health

For each venture, search VCMS for the most recent code-review scorecard:
crane_notes(tag=\"code-review\", venture=\"{VENTURE_CODE}\", limit=1)

Extract overall grade and review date. If no scorecard exists, mark as "-". If older than 30 days, mark grade with "(stale)".

### Step 3: Present Review Table

```
### Portfolio Review - {date}

| Venture | Status | Proposed | BVM Stage | Code Health | Last Commit | URL Health | Signals |
|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|------------|---------|
| ...     | ...    | ...      | ...       | ...         | ...         | ...        | ...     |
```

If drift was detected, display prominently:
```
### Drift Detected
- {venture}: {description} - consider {status}?
```

### Step 4: Captain Approval

Ask: "Approve these portfolio statuses?"
Options: "Approve all" / "Review individually" / "Skip"

If "Review individually": walk through each venture one by one.

### Step 5: Publish Updates

**Step A: Update crane-console**
1. Update `config/ventures.json`: set `lastPortfolioReview` to today, update any changed fields
2. Commit: `chore: portfolio review {date}`
3. Push to main

**Step B: Update vc-web**
1. Read updated `config/ventures.json`
2. Update `vc-web/src/data/ventures.ts`: sync statuses, descriptions, techStack, URLs. Only include ventures where `showInPortfolio: true`.
3. Commit: `chore: sync portfolio data from review {date}`
4. Push to main

After both pushes, record cadence:
crane_schedule(action: \"complete\", name: \"portfolio-review\", result: \"success\", summary: \"Portfolio reviewed and published\")

### Step 6: Align VCMS (if needed)

If any BVM stage or description changed, update the corresponding VCMS executive summary using crane_note MCP tool with action \"update\".

## Notes

- Never auto-promote to `paused` or `sunset` - Captain-only decisions
- Signals are ephemeral - collected live, displayed once, not persisted
- `config/ventures.json` is the single source of truth for portfolio data
- `vc-web/src/data/ventures.ts` is a derivative that can be regenerated
