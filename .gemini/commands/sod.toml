description = "Start of Day - Load session context and operational documentation"

prompt = """
You are starting a new development session.

Execute the Start of Day script to load session context from Crane Context Worker:

!{bash scripts/sod-universal.sh}

The script will:
- Detect the current repository and venture
- Load session context from Crane Context Worker
- Cache operational documentation to /tmp/crane-context/docs/
- Display handoffs from previous sessions
- Show GitHub issues and work queues

After the script completes, you will have:
- Complete operational documentation cached locally
- Session context from previous work
- Visibility into current work priorities
- GitHub issue status across all queues

Use the cached documentation at /tmp/crane-context/docs/ as reference for team workflows, API specs, and project standards throughout this session.

IMPORTANT: After the script completes:
1. CONFIRM CONTEXT: State the venture and repo shown in the Context Confirmation box. Ask user to confirm this is correct.
2. STOP and wait for the user to tell you what to work on. Do NOT automatically start working on issues.
3. Present a brief summary and ask "What would you like to focus on?" then wait for their response.

If you create any GitHub issues during this session, they MUST go to the repo shown in Context Confirmation. If you find yourself targeting a different repo, STOP and verify with the user.
